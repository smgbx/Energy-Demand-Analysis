# HiveQL

Each sub-folder here represents a HiveQL query command result. I added the column names by hand, I could not figure out a way to force HiveQL to add them automatically

The created graphs from this information is stored within the 'Graphs' subfolder. Some query results turned into more than one Graph

All of the queries written are attacked in 'HQL Queries.txt'. These are unorganized and represent all past creation of tables, importing of data and queries for the second iteration
